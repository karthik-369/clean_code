1. Sideeffect issue.Session is initialize but not deinitialized it may cause side effect somewhere else in the code.
2. Sideeffect issue.Name is declared global and splitting the variable inside the method may cause side effect.
3. The condition is double negative which can be confusing, instead change the name of the method.
4. Redundant function calls happening(eg:GetMaxAltitude()- function), missing default return value here.
5. No return statement,Create interface insteadof typechecks each time
6. Create another function to create temporary file instead of using boolean parameters.
7. Return type missing in GetInstance function, its violating singleton principle ,cause it can create multiple instances
